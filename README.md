# OmniAnalyze 2026 🛡️

A state-of-the-art file intelligence platform designed and developed by **Tarunjit Biswas**. OmniAnalyze bridges the gap between complex binary data and human understanding, offering instant safety verdicts and deep content insights.

## 🚀 The Vision
In an era of increasing digital complexity, OmniAnalyze provides a transparent window into any file. We believe you shouldn't need a degree in cybersecurity to know if a file is safe or what it contains.

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. Hybrid Intelligence Engine
- **Free Mode (Signature Scan)**: Performs instant, client-side heuristic analysis using file signatures and magic bytes. No API key or internet required for basic safety checks.
- **Pro Mode (AI Deep Dive)**: Powered by **Gemini 3 Pro**, this mode performs an exhaustive inspection of file contents, code logic, and hidden metadata.

### 2. Interactive AI Assistant
- Chat directly with your documents or code.
- Ask questions like: *"Is there any hidden tracking code in this HTML?"* or *"Summarize the legal risks in this PDF."*
- Supports large context windows for complex file analysis.

### 3. Comprehensive File Support
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD.
- **Web**: HTML, HTM, JS, JSON, SVG.
- **System**: EXE, MSI, BAT, SH, ZIP, RAR.
- **Media**: PNG, JPG, WEBP, HEIC.

### 4. Privacy-First Architecture
- Basic analysis happens entirely on your machine.
- AI analysis only occurs if you explicitly provide your own API key.
- No files are stored permanently; all analysis happens in volatile memory.

## 🛠️ Technical Excellence
- **Frontend**: React 19 (ES6 Modules)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a high-end "Glassmorphism" UI.
- **AI Integration**: Google GenAI SDK (@google/genai).
- **Icons**: Lucide React.
