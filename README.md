# OmniAnalyze PRO

A human-centric, high-intelligence file analysis tool powered by **Gemini 3 Pro**. Built to bridge the gap between complex file structures and human understanding.

## 🚀 Vision
OmniAnalyze doesn't just scan files; it explains them. Whether it's a suspicious `.exe`, a legal `PDF`, or a dense source code file, OmniAnalyze tells you exactly what's inside in plain English.

## ✨ Features
- **Human-First Analysis**: Get safety verdicts like "Safe," "Caution," or "Danger" in simple terms.
- **Interactive Assistant**: Chat directly with the file. Ask "Is this good?" or "What does this code do?" and get a human-like response.
- **Broad Compatibility**: Supports `.html`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.exe`, `.zip`, and more.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully optimized for phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **Vercel Ready**: Pre-configured for instant deployment.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 (ESM)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini 3 Pro via `@google/genai`
